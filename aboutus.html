    <h1>About UFQ Education</h1>
    <p class="blog-date">Updated: July 8, 2025</p>

    <p>
      <strong>UFQ Education</strong> is an independent educational platform built with one mission: to uplift students across Uzbekistan and Central Asia through free, honest, and motivating educational content.
    </p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      UFQ is run by passionate students, learners, and future leaders — just like you. We believe education is the foundation of success, and every student deserves guidance that’s clear, real, and empowering.
    </p>

    <h2>🎯 Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      - Make education accessible and inspiring  
      - Share stories that motivate youth  
      - Connect students to global opportunities  
      - Keep things simple, powerful, and pure
    </p>

    <h2>💬 Why We Exist</h2>
    <p>
      Because we know the struggle: no mentors, no direction, no motivation. UFQ was created to change that — with blogs, guides, interviews, and real talk. Whether you’re trying to win scholarships, learn better, or just keep going — we’re here for you.
    </p>

    <h2>What “UFQ” Stands For</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>UFQ = Ustozlar, Future, Qadr.</strong><br />
      It’s about Teachers, Future, and Value — honoring those who guide us, building the future, and respecting what matters.
    </p>

    <h2>💡 Our Dream</h2>
    <p>
      To see every young Muslim and student rise with confidence, knowledge, and faith — and build a better Ummah through learning.
    </p>
